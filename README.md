# How to run the project
- Clone the project
- Run `yarn start` or `yarn start:clean` for removing cache and node_modules

# Possible Improvements if I'd have more time 
- Add tests
- Add more error handling and user feedback for better user experience

# Some answers
- React-navigation ? It's just a single screen app.
- Performance ? It might be improved by using React.memo and React.useCallback didn't focus on performance much.

## Other Details
- You can use `npx prisma studio` to view the database in a nice UI.
- Swagger is available at http://localhost:3000/api
